# üìä  Data Management for Data Science - CS 210

Hi! I‚Äôm Raj Shah, a senior double major in Computer Science and Data Science at Rutgers University.  
This repository contains my coursework and projects from **CS 210: Data Management for Data Science**, where I worked with Python and Excel to acquire, clean, analyze, and visualize real-world datasets using Jupyter Notebook.

## üß∞ Tools & Skills
- **Programming:** Python 3  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Data Management:** CSV, Excel, JSON  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib charts, exploratory data visualization  
- **Database Skills:** Relational Databases (SQL), basic NoSQL exposure  
- **Other Skills:** Data cleaning, data curation, pattern discovery, workflow documentation

## üìÇ Projects & Hands-On Work

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Curation
- Loaded real-world datasets from CSV and Excel files  
- Handled missing, duplicate, and inconsistent data  
- Applied domain-independent and domain-dependent methods for data cleaning  
- Used Python libraries like **Pandas** and **NumPy** for efficient data management  

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Analysis & Visualization
- Explored datasets to discover patterns, distributions, and correlations  
- Created visualizations such as histograms, bar charts, scatter plots, and line plots using **Matplotlib**  
- Conducted basic statistical summaries and insights generation  

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Relational Database Work
- Converted curated datasets into **SQL-ready formats**  
- Performed basic SQL queries to manage and extract insights from relational databases  
- Optional exploration of **NoSQL data management**  

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Generative AI Integration
- Incorporated GenAI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) for workflow assistance, such as generating code templates and automating repetitive tasks  
- Ensured all programming skills were learned and applied manually; AI was only used as a helper  

---

## üîó Additional Notes
- Projects were executed in **Jupyter Notebook**, combining Python code, visualizations, and narrative explanations.  
- Excel was used for initial data review and quick cleaning before Python processing.  
- Demonstrates ability to acquire, clean, explore, and visualize real-world datasets efficiently.
