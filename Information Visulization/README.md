## üìÇ Projects & Hands-On Work

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Tableau Dashboards & Data Analytics
- Created interactive dashboards to highlight patterns, trends, and insights from real-world datasets.  
- Conducted **descriptive and trend analysis**, correlations, and data summarization to uncover actionable insights.  
- Applied calculated fields, filters, and hierarchies for deeper analysis.  

**Sample Projects:**  
- **Broadway Revenue Analysis:** Visualized trends in ticket sales and top-performing shows across weeks, analyzed revenue patterns and attendance.  
- **Disney Movie Revenue:** Explored gross revenue trends (1937‚Äì2016) using bar charts, line charts, and scatter plots; identified top-performing genres and seasonal trends.  
- **NYC 311 Resolution Satisfaction:** Story-driven dashboards analyzing correlations between resolution times and public satisfaction, highlighting key areas for service improvement.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Design & Human Perception Principles
- Applied insights from **Tufte, Berinato, and Schwabish** to avoid misleading visualizations and improve clarity.  
- Focused on chart selection, color usage, and information hierarchy for better storytelling.  
- Designed dashboards for both **exploratory analysis** and **presentation-ready insights**.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Multimedia & Presentation
- Created story-based dashboards and presentations, combining visualizations with narrative to communicate insights effectively.  
- Optional use of video or web-based multimedia to complement data storytelling.  

---

## üîó Additional Notes
- All dashboards include clear titles, annotations, and interactive elements.  
- Emphasizes both **technical skills** (Tableau, Power BI) and **data analytics skills** (cleaning, profiling, summarization, trend analysis, correlation).  
- Coursework demonstrates the ability to transform raw data into meaningful, actionable insights.
