## üìÇ Projects & Hands-On Work

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Python Networking Projects
- Implemented network applications and protocol simulations using Python 3 in a Linux environment.  
- Developed scripts to work with **sockets, TCP/UDP communication, and HTTP requests**.  
- Applied networking concepts from lectures into real Python-based exercises.  

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Linux-Based Execution
- All projects were developed and executed in a **Linux environment**, allowing hands-on experience with command-line tools, file management, and Python package management.  
- Gained familiarity with Linux-based debugging, shell commands, and script execution.
