# üìä Statistical Inference for Data Science ‚Äì STAT291

Hi! I‚Äôm Raj Shah, a senior double major in Computer Science and Data Science at Rutgers University.  
This repository contains my coursework and hands-on exercises from **STAT291: Statistical Inference for Data Science**, with all practical coding done in **R**. It demonstrates my skills in hypothesis testing, regression, sampling, bootstrapping, and data visualization.

## üß∞ Tools & Skills
- **Programming:** R  
- **Data Analysis:** Descriptive statistics, probability distributions, hypothesis testing, regression analysis  
- **Visualization:** `ggplot2`, base R plots  
- **Techniques:** Sampling, bootstrapping, confidence intervals, A/B testing, ANOVA, Chi-square tests

## üìÇ Portfolio Structure

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Descriptive Statistics & Probability
- Summarized datasets (mean, median, variance, standard deviation)  
- Visualized distributions with histograms, boxplots, scatterplots  
- Explored random variables and simulated probability distributions  

**Sample Files:**  
- `Measure_of_center_and_variation_2.ppt`  
- `Probability_1.pptx`  
- `Conditional_probability_1.pptx`  

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Sampling & Bootstrapping
- Implemented random sampling from datasets  
- Built bootstrap resampling methods for estimating confidence intervals  
- Applied sampling techniques for hypothesis testing  

**Sample Files / Code:**  
- `reference_code_for_Sampling.docx`  
- `Bootstrapping_reference_code.docx`  
- `Coding_for_Sampling.mp4`  
- `Coding_for_Bootstrapping.mp4`  

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Regression Analysis
- Built simple and multiple linear regression models using `lm()`  
- Interpreted coefficients, R¬≤, residuals, and diagnostic plots  
- Tested regression hypotheses and constructed confidence intervals  

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Confidence Intervals & Hypothesis Testing
- One-sample and two-sample t-tests  
- Proportion tests and paired sample tests  
- Confidence intervals for population means and proportions  
- Chi-square tests and ANOVA for categorical data  
- A/B testing simulations  

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Data Visualization
- Created clear and informative visualizations in R for both exploratory and presentation purposes  
- Integrated plots into analysis of regression, CI, and hypothesis testing  

---

## üîó Additional Notes
- All coding exercises were completed in **RStudio**.  
- This repo demonstrates applied statistical inference from lecture concepts to real-world data analysis.
